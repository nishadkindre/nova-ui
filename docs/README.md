# 📚 NovaUI Component Library Documentation

Welcome to the NovaUI Component Library documentation! This library provides simple, reusable React components that you can use in your projects.

## 🚀 What is NovaUI?

NovaUI is a beginner-friendly React component library that provides ready-to-use UI components like buttons and input fields. Think of it as a collection of building blocks for your website or app.

**Imagine building with LEGO blocks** - instead of creating every piece from scratch, you can use our pre-made components and customize them to fit your needs!
